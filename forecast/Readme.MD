Senior Final Project: Spring 2022. 

 

1. Management will signup as individuals first
2. They will then forecast and use the application as individuals
3. They will then switch and create admin accounts and work as admin
4. Admin accounts should have full access
5. Individual accounts will only have individual access
6. supervisors will have limited access (based on their departments). 

Once this has taken place, and I have received feedback, I will need to know what needs to be changed, what can be modified etc. I also have an idea of adding features of the app I created in the fall because my work needs something similar due to using an outdated platform. 


Lastly is security. I need to figure out how to secure the app itself and then have a few testers to test the security of the application.
