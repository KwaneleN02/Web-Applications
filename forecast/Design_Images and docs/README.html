<!-- 
    ABOUT THIS APPLICATION:

    Idea:
    There is sometthing about spreadsheets that doesn't sit well with me in a professional workplace. My work is currently using spreadsheets for the functionalities incorporated in this app. I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can take a problem, an existing problem, and automate it. 

    Solving what problem?:

    The app is essentially taking sales forecasting based on what has been won and what a sales department predicts overall will close either lost or won. Using spreadsheets,they meet to discuss what percentage each sales person is at each week and where they "forecast" to land on by the end of the week. 

    Technologies used: 

    HTML5 : Markup
    CSS3: Styling
    Vanilla Javascript: Interactivity and form toggling
    SQL/MySQL: Database design
    MAMP: Server
    Object Oriented PHP 8.0 : Backend/server side rendering
    AJAX: Connecting backend and front-end to display JSON data in charts


    Frameworks: 
    Materialize: CSS

    JQUERY UI: Tabs

    CHARTS.JS: Charts Design

   Visual Studio Code: Text Editor 


   Reason for PHP: 

   I went with OOP PHP 8.0 to write a cleaner and scalable code that's easy to maintain and read in the future. I am still learning OOP and hoping that this will take to the MVC path and hopefully creating my own small framework.
